Grace, James, Ilgin &amp; Tom's HackSheffield project

Created as part of HackSheffield5 2019

Our project is to create a website to analyse a news article and determine the level of bias using sentiment analysis in python.

## Guide to directory

 - Python code is under 'python_tools'. This includes:
   - sentiment.py, which calculates the bias in a sample of text
   - parse_ttf.py, which was originally used to parse the Subjectivity Lexicon ttf file 
   [Theresa Wilson, Janyce Wiebe, and Paul Hoffmann (2005). Recognizing Contextual Polarity in Phrase-Level Sentiment Analysis. Proc. of HLT-EMNLP-2005. ]
   - Dataset.txt, a simplified text version of the above dataset
   - The requirements for the python code (nltk)
   
 - 'fake_news' and 'node_modules' contain the code used to produce the website.
